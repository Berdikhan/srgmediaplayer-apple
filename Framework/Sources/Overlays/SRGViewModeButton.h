/**
 *  A button to change between view modes for the associated player view (@see `SRGMediaPlayerView`), e.g. between
 *  360Â° and cardboard displays. This class is not meant to be subclassed.
 *
 *  Simply install an instance somewhere onto your custom player interface and bind to the media player view which
 *  the button must be associated with. The button will be hidden automatically if no view mode switch is available.
 *  If your controls are stacked using a `UIStackView`, the layout will automatically adjust when the button appears
 *  or disappears.
 *
 *  The button is automatically shown or hidden by having its `hidden` property automatically adjusted. Attempting
 *  to manually alter this property leads to undefined behavior. You can force the button to always be hidden by
 *  setting its `alwaysHidden` property to `YES` if needed.
