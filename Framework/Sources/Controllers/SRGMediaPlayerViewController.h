/**
 *  A lightweight `AVPlayerViewController` subclass, but using an `SRGMediaPlayerController` for playback. This class
 *  provides standard Apple user experience at the expense of a few limitations:
 *    - 360Â° medias are not playable with monoscopic or stereoscopic support.
 *    - Background playback behavior cannot be customized.
 *
 *  If you need one of these features, implement your own player layout instead.
 *
 *  Since `AVPlayerViewController` also manages video player layers as well, note that the picture in picture controller
 *  associated with an `SRGMediaPlayerController` is not used.
